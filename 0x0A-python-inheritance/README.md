Requirements
Python Scripts

Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.4.3)
All your files should end with a new line
The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/python3
A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
Your code should use the PEP 8 style (version 1.7.*)
All your files must be executable
The length of your files will be tested using wc
Python Test Cases
Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
All your files should end with a new line
All your test files should be inside a folder tests
All your test files should be text files (extension: .txt)
All your tests should be executed by using this command: python3 -m doctest ./tests/*
All your modules should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(import("my_module").doc)')
All your classes should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(import("my_module").MyClass.doc)')
All your functions (inside and outside a class) should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(import("my_module").my_function.doc)' and python3 -c 'print(import("my_module").MyClass.my_function.doc)')
We strongly encourage you to work together on test cases, so that you don’t miss any edge case
0. Lookup
Write a function that returns the list of available attributes and methods of an object:

Prototype: def lookup(obj):

Returns a list object

You are not allowed to import any module

guillaume@ubuntu:~/0x0A$ cat 0-main.py
#!/usr/bin/python3
lookup = __import__('0-lookup').lookup

class MyClass1(object):
    pass

class MyClass2(object):
    my_attr1 = 3
    def my_meth(self):
        pass

print(lookup(MyClass1))
print(lookup(MyClass2))
print(lookup(int))

guillaume@ubuntu:~/0x0A$ ./0-main.py
